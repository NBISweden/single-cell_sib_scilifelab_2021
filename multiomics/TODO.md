### TO DO / DISCUSS

- more prefiltering of the ATAC data
- run dimensionality reduction methods on scATAC data (cisTopic, peakVI, LSI, ChromVAR)
- Vignette and package requirements for MOFA
- Prepare vignettes and references for:
    - GenomicRanges and a python equivalent
    - R to python conversions: using R in python, using python in R, 
    - List of useful tools: chromVAR, Seurat vignettes, muon vignettes, MOFA
    
- Should the unmatched group have access to the matched dataset too? e.g. for benchmarking
- Should the data be in the github repo or not?
- Do peak to gene mapping function?
- Compute and save ChromVAR background peaks?
- Should peak to gene search downsized to a set of known marker genes?
