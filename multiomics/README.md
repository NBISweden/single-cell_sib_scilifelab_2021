# Integrative analysis of single-cell multi-omic data

The development of single-cell assays for multiple molecular modalities other than gene expression provides a powerful tool for investigating multiple dimensions of cellular heterogeneity. Here we will be analyzing gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles generated with scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq from the same tissue to identify genomic regions involved in cellular differentiation. We will use data integration techniques for experimental designs where both data modalities are simultaneously profiled from the same cells (vertical integration) and for designs where scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq are applied to separate groups of cells from the same tissue (diagonal integration).
