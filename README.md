# Joint SciLifeLab-SIB Summer School for
# Advanced topics in Single Cell Omics

29.08.2021 - 03.09.2021 - RÃ¥nÃ¤s Castle near Stockholm

<br/>

Bioinformatics has always been a foundation for understanding RNA. This importance has only grown with the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS), as rapidly diversifying methods have been developed to study virtually all aspects of RNA, including expression, processing, structure and translation. While these techniques are based on a common foundation of NGS, each has unique aspects that remain within the realm of specialists. This presents a challenge for young researchers wishing to add these techniques to their skills toolkit.
The aim of this School is to broaden early-stage researchersâ€™ expertise in RNA bioinformatics, with a particular focus on NGS-based analyses. Participants will gain an overview of the state-of-the-art in RNA bioinformatics, before embarking on a challenging, hands-on training project in a chosen area. Learning will be guided by experts from fields including single cell RNA analysis, long-read RNA sequencing, ribosome-profiling and UV cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP-seq). There will be a focus on team-work and many opportunities for networking with trainers and other participants.

**Audience**
This course is aimed at early-stage researchers (PhD students, postdocs) in the RNA field. Given the course subject matter, only participants with working knowledge of scientific computing can be considered (see Requirements for further details).

***

After a first day about RNA-seq overview, the remainder of the School will focus on group mini-projects.

We will work with 4 topics and there will be 2 groups of 4 participants for each topic. The groups will be composed in advance, based on a survey the applicants will complete. There will be about 2 tutors per project.

The last day, the groups will present their project.

***

At the end of this school, the participants should be able to:
- have a good understanding of the most common methods of RNA-seq analysis,
- repeat the same type of analysis achieved during the mini-project,
- present the mini-project and more globally disseminate their experience to the members of their group.

**Pre-requisites - background knowledge**
- Previous intermediate experience with single cell RNA-seq analysis
- Familiar with command line and UNIX language
- Intermediate/advanced usage of R / Python

**Pre-requisites - material & software**
- The participants must bring a laptop with install permissions (admin). A list of software to be installed in advance will be communicated on due time.
